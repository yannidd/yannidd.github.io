  <p>I proposed my dissertation project to Dr Jize Yan who was impressed by my idea. The project was to implement an air drumming device - a business idea I have had for a while. To play the drums, a drummer only needs a pair of drumsticks, one or two foot sensors and a mobile phone - this allows playing drums anywhere. Before I continue with the description, I would like to show a short video of my project, which the University of Southampton decided to play on open days (to attract students to electronics and computer science).</p>

  <h2>Detecting Strikes</h2>

  <p>Two approaches were used for detecting strikes. The first one was a custom, manually tuned, peak-detection algorithm which detects sharp peaks in acceleration (my research found that these correspond to strikes) while filtering noise. This algorithm works in real-time and it has a one sample delay between the peak occurence and its detection.</p>

  <figure id>
    <img src="img/peak_finding.svg">
    <figcaption>
        A state diagram of the strike detection algorithm. $a$ is the linear drumstick acceleration and $\dot{a}$ and $\ddot{a}$ are its two time derivatives. $a_{th}$, $\ddot{a_{th}}$ and $t_{dth}$ are three constants. Their optimal values have been found by inspection to be respectively $1.953ms^{-2}$, $0.733ms^{-4}$ and $20ms$.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The second approach for motion detection was by implementing a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network on a microcontroller. This allowed for motion detection that could be easily extended to different types of motion by retraining. Below is a structure of the network I used.</p> 

  <figure id>
    <img width="600px" src="img/lstm.svg">
    <figcaption>
      A structure of the LSTM network. The LSTM layers consist of 64 and 32 units respectively, and the Dense layer before the output consists of 16 units.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  This network would output the strike label for the whole duration of the strike peak. However, only a spike is desired to trigger a drum sound. To solve this, a helper network (see below) was stacked at the strike output, which will output 1 when 'Strike' transitions from 0 to 1, and 0 otherwise.

    <img width="450px" src="img/helper_network.svg">
    <figcaption>

  </figure>

  <h2>Game Development for Automatic Data Labelling</h2>

  <p>One of the biggest problems that I faced was how to obtain a large datased of labelled data. Drumming requires very specific motions so there were no public datasets that I could use online. Manual labelling would be hugely impractical and prone to errors. Writing an algorithm that can label the data automatically would eliminate the need of a neural network for generalised motion detection. Hitting conductive surfaces and looking at the voltage waveform would not work either because there is a difference between the acceleration waveform of striking the air and striking a surface. These are just a few of the ideas I had which had flaws and would not work.</p>

  <p>One day I finally found a solution. What if I could develop a game in which the player uses the drumstick as controller and he/she is forced to perform the drumming motion in order to win? If the player passed the level, then I could be sure that the acceleration waveform that I logged corresponds to a drumming motion. Eureka!</p>

  <p>Below are a few screenshots of the game with the acceleration waveform underneath them. The player has to stay inside the blue tunnel while the spacecraft (the white arrow) progresses forwards at a constant speed. Hitting the walls of the blue tunnel causes the spacecraft to explode. The curves in the game were adapted, such that when flying through them, the player performs a drum strike motion with the drumstick. The width of the tunnel allows for variation in the strikes.</p>

  <figure id>
    <img width="650px" src="img/game.png">
    <figcaption>
        Plot of the logged acceleration data while passing certain sections of the game. The orange bounds represent the parts in which the acceleration data is labelled as “strike”; at any other time, the data is labelled as “no strike”. The distinctive acceleration peaks of air strikes are clearly visible at the curvy paths.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>A total of 2 hours of data was collected from 4 different players (About 1100 labelled samples of acceleration data). The data was pre-processed as shown in the figure below. The trained network achieved a 100% accuracy and performed as expected when ported on the drumstick's microcontroller.</p>
