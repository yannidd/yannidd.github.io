Hi! I'm Yani. I finished an electronics degree this year, and now I am doing a master's in artificial intelligence. In my free time I like to broaden my knowledge in these fields by reading books, papers and doing personal projects. Some of my hobbies are swimming, bouldering, skiing and longboarding. Thank you for visitting my website.
